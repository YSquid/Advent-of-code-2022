## Advent of Code 2022 - Solutions ##

- This will be my first year doing [Advent of Code Puzzles.](https://adventofcode.com/)

- All of my solutions will be posted to this repo as I complete. Some days I split the code into two parts, some days its all in one file. 
    - *e.g. Day_2 has day2-1.js and day2-2.js, but Day_6 only has day6.js*


- All solutions will be done in JavaScript.

- If at all possible, I will avoid hardcoding inputs and instead read them into my JS files from the plain txt input files (day 1 is only exception so far).

*"If it's stupid and it works - it's not stupid"*
